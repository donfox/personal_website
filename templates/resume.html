          <a href="https://emrts.us/" target="_blank">https://emrts.us/</a><br>
          <p><strong><em>Note:</em> Electronic Medical Records Technical Solutions (EMRTS) was a startup addressing various 
            medical IT needs, including medical records, billing, scheduling, provider enrollment, and claims 
            processing, using open-source technology. Across five separate engagements, I worked as a freelance 
            developer, contributing on a project-by-project basis rather than a fixed full-time schedule. The nature of 
            these projects was primarily research and development, often requiring rapid prototyping and collaboration 
            with academics from North Carolina A&T University and other developers via Git and Skype.</strong></p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>August 23, 2023 – September 2024:</strong> Initially worked with interns on Medicaid to 
                prediction research and introduced foundational data science concepts. Later, we added another project 
                to investigate cryptocurrency, that lead onto the development of a Bitcoin indexer prototype that could 
                then developed into a production ready tool. This was still ongoing September, but placed on the 
                back-burner when those students who were involved resumed their studies at school.<br>
                <strong>Tools:</strong> macOS, Windows, the EMRTS Linux network, and GitHub for version control. 
                Development relied heavily on Python 3.x and Flask, Databases used included PostgreSQL.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>July 2015 – January 2017:</strong> Developed proof-of-concept tools and prototypes for processing
                medical transaction data (EDI_X12_837) and handling large medical provider datasets (JSON, XML). Extended
                a web services application for state governments and clinics to facilitate medical provider data 
                registration and validation.
                <br><strong>Tools:</strong> Python 3.5, PostgreSQL, Django, JavaScript | <strong>Platform:</strong> Unix
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>October 2013 – March 2014:</strong> Worked on research-driven projects related to mobile medical 
              screenings and provider enrollment for state governments. Contributed to developing a Health Information 
              Exchange (HIE) application for hospitals.<br>
              <strong>Tools:</strong> Elixir/Phoenix | <strong>Platform:</strong> Ubuntu Linux, macOS |
              <strong>Databases:</strong> MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>November 2011 – March 2012:</strong> Focused on electronic medical records, claims processing, and
              provider enrollment applications on GNU/Linux. Developed tools for handling JSON data and extended the 
              application’s support for additional records processing.<br>
              <strong>Tools:</strong> Python, Django, JavaScript (jQuery, Node.js) | 
              <strong>Databases:</strong> MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Redis
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>July 2009 – May 2010:</strong> 
              Conducted code analysis for GNUmed 
              (<a href="https://www.gnumed.de/documentation">GNUmed Documentation</a>), an open-source electronic 
              medical record system, to evaluate its suitability for client needs. Built a RESTful web service for 
              state medical provider validation.<br>

          workshops and sessions. I provided recommendations to enhance the site’s functionality and robustness. This 
          remote project utilized Python 3.9, Django 3.1, PostgreSQL 14.1, Docker, and Azure.
