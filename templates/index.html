        With over 25 years of experience as a software developer, I specialize in backend development on Unix platforms, having worked in  diverse domains such as telecommunications, finance, medical records processing, and more. I've also done some occasional web development. In addition, I have mentored interns on various projects. I am currently seeking remote contracts or freelance opportunities to work on innovative projects.
      <p>

        Currently, I am exploring blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies, as well as functional programming and related paradigms using Lisp, Scheme, and Haskell. During recent R&D work, I developed a basic prototype for a Bitcoin indexer using Elixir, which was also a pedagogical tool  developed along with some of our interns. I look forward to applying these paradigms in future projects.

        This site serves as a hub to share my resume, reflections on books and articles, and a portfolio of projects that range from practical applications to abstract explorations inspired by thinkers like GÃ¶del and G. Spencer-Brown.
