      <p>
        With over 25 years of experience in software development, I specialize in backend engineering on Unix platforms.
        My work spans diverse fields, including telecommunications, finance, and medical records processing, with 
        occasional forays into web development. I've also, more recently, mentored interns on various projects. I am 
        currently seeking remote contracts or freelance opportunities for interesting and engaging work.
      </p>

     <p>
        Currently, I am exploring blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies while deepening my experience with 
        functional programming and related paradigms. During recent R&D work, I collaborated with interns on developing
        a prototype Bitcoin indexer as a pedagogical tool, which has the potential to become a production-ready 
        application.

        This site serves as a space to share my resume, project portfolio, and reflections on books and articles. My 
        interests range from practical applications to abstract explorations, which will be reflected in my reading list
        and upcoming projects that Iâ€™ll continue adding to my portfolio on GitHub.
      </p>


      <p>Feel free to explore my resume, or connect with me for potential collaborations. </p>
